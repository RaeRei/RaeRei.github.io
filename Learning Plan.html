                            I have come to learn a skill, to share with whomever is keen to learn in my Whanau, Hapu and Iwi.
                            So my long term goal is to ensure that this knowledge is accesible and available. 
                            That this skill continues to grow within my community, which i really believe provides
                            an opportunity for Whanau to experience and participate in the world of Technology.
                            is shared with 
                            Career Pathway - Is I get to do what I enjoy doing, and being, which is Whanau, Education, Sports and Community.
