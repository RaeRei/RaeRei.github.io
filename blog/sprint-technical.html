    <h1>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding</h1>
      <h2>Margin</h2>

        <p>The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin 
           and the individual properties are margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.</p>

          <h2>Boarder</h2>

         <p>  The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. 
              This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:</p>
              <ul>     
                 <li> border-top, </li> 
                 <li> border-right, </li> 
                 <li> border-bottom, </li> 
                 <li> border-left, </li>  </ul>
              Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.
              <ul>     
                  <li> border-width, </li> 
                  <li> border-style, </li> 
                  <li> border-color, </li> 
               </ul>
              Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.
              You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, 
              <ul>     
                  <li> border-top-width, </li> 
                  <li> border-top-style, </li> 
                  <li> border-top-color, etc </li> 
               </ul> 
          </p>

          <h2>Padding</h2>
         <p> The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:
              border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left: Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.
              border-width, border-style, border-color: Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.
              You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, using border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc.
