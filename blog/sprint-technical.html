      <h2>Margin</h2>

        <p>The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin 
           and the individual properties are:</p>
           <ul>     
              <li> margin-top, </li> 
              <li> margin-right, </li> 
              <li> margin-bottom, </li>
              <li> margin-left, </li> 
           </ul>

          <h2>Boarder</h2>

         <p>  The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it 
              invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these 
              on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. 
              This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:</p>
              <ul>     
                 <li> border-top, </li> 
                 <li> border-right, </li> 
                 <li> border-bottom, </li> 
                 <li> border-left, </li>  </ul>

              Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.
              <ul>     
                  <li> border-width, </li> 
                  <li> border-style, </li> 
                  <li> border-color, </li> 
               </ul>

              Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.
              You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, 
              <ul>     
                  <li> border-top-width, </li> 
                  <li> border-top-style, </li> 
                  <li> border-top-color, etc </li> 
               </ul> 
          </p>


          <h2>Padding</h2>
         <p>Padding refers to the inner margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this 
            layer can be set on all four sides at once with the padding shorthand property, or one side at a time with:
          </p>
          <ul>     
              <li> padding-top, </li> 
              <li> padding-right, </li> 
              <li> padding-bottom, </li> 
              <li> padding-left properties, </li> 
           </ul>
          

          <h2>Differences</h2>
         <p> Differences - The margin surrounds the box, and the boarder is the buffer between the padding and the margin. The padding 
             is the buffer between the content and the boarder. </p> 
          <p>Each margin, boarder and padding can be changed to specific color, size, and look, to exactly present what you would like on your website. </p>
          <p>It is also important to note that the lay out of your website, and where you position your box, you will also change the distance from the margin to the other 
             objects on you web page.
          </p>
