                          <p> Carol Dweck </p>
                          <br>
                          Dr. Dweck’s research, compelling and thorough, challenges this widely held belief, or ‘fixed mindset’, by demonstrating how powerful a ‘growth mindset’ 
                          can be in achieving success and happiness.</p>

                          <br>

                         <p>  For me this was great, According to psychologist Carol Dweck, known for her research on an individual’s implicit theory of intelligence, “In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. 
                           They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb.”  </p>

                          <br>

                          “You’re so talented!”, “You are gifted – a natural!”, “You’re doing so well in school, you must be really smart!” – children receive these messages (or their negative counterparts), along with many other 
                          messages on a daily basis from their peers, parents and teachers. Are these just words or do they mean more? How are children affected by the words we use to praise,coach and criticize them?

                            <p>Here are a few tips for making your classroom friendly to malleable brains:

                              Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.

                              <br>

                              <p>Put information in context. Recognising that learning is, essentially, the formation of new or stronger neural connections, it makes sense to prioritise activities that help students tap into already-existing 
                              pathways (for instance, by integrating academic subjects or creating class projects relevant to their lives). In other words, nix the rote memorization. 
                              "Whenever new material is presented in such a way that students see relationships" between concepts, writes Willis, "they generate greater brain cell activity and achieve more successful 
                              long-term memory storage and retrieval."</p>

                              <br> 

                              Let students know that this is how the brain works. Breaking through those neuro-mythological barriers that paint intelligence as predetermined may ease students' minds and encourage them to use their brains. 
                              Willis notes, "Especially for students who believe they are 'not smart,' the realization that they can literally change their brains through study and review is empowering."</p>
