  <h2> <p> What is Emotional Intelligence?</p> </h2>

        <p>  For me Emotional Intelligence is self-awareness which is your Identity, to know and understanding 
          who you are and where you come from, strenghtens you from the inside out. 

          <p> This guy puts it down like this:</p>
          <p>The 5 Components/Elements/Domains of the EQ Model,  According to Daniel Goleman, there are five components or elements of emotional intelligence:</p>
          
       <ul> 
        <li>Self-Awareness</li>
        <li>Self-Regulation</li>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Social Skills</li>
      </ul>   
  
        </p>
  <h2> <p> How is it different to IQ?</p> </h2>
        <p> The difference between EQ and IQ. IQ is Intelligence like academic, like brainy people where they can be tested
          and graded. </p>
         <p> EQ is a quality of Self awareness like empathy and intuition, qualities that cannot be measured or tested.
        </p>


  <h2> <p> Why is it Important?</p></h2>
        <p>Both are important, depending on who you and where you come from. </p>
        <p> For me EQ is very much a well being of self, well being of environment, and well being of wairua. Self awareness or Identity 
            strenghtens who I am, respecting who I am and others around me. EQ enables freedom of responsibility and motivation.
            EQ is also learnt through emotions, the senses, visual, touch etc.
            <p>IQ has a different set of talents, which are important to many, which can be measured to see who is clever-er then the others, can even be 
              displayed with a Masters or PHD certificate which can be trained and studied for.
