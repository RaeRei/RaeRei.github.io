    <h1>Sprint 3 Technical</h1>

    <h2>As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:</h2>
    <p>

            <ul>     
                   <h2><li> An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</li> </h2> 

                     <p>  So my analogy between HTML <strong> Hyper Text Markup Language, </strong> and CSS <strong>Cascading Style Sheets is: </strong></p>
                         HTML is the structure of any website, it provides the basic written content, wrapped in tags. </ul</p>
                      <p> CSS provides design and styles, from font, size and colours to position of elements for the user. CSS will provide the visual look and feel of your website.</p>
                      <p> HTML and CSS can actually provide a great foundation and present a really good website, Javascript adds the awesomeness or majic to a website.</p>
                <p> 
                   <h2><li> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 
                         'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</li></h2></p>
                         <p>
                            Control flow is simply the flow in which things (code) move. Code will run in order or sequence unless loops or breaks are submitted in code. 
                            And loops are conditions that dependant on the instructions continue to repeat until instruction dictate otherwise. </p>
                            <p>Example:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>I want a cuppa tea.</li>
                                <li> Put the kettle on</li>
                                <li> grab a cup</li>
                                <li> grab a teabag - Black tea or Green tea</li>
                                <li> Hot water time </li>
                                <li> milk or sugar</li>
                                <li> sit and enjoy - if you don't have to go back to work</li>

                            </ul>

                            

                     <h2><li> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </li></h2>

                <p> The DOM stands for Document Object Model, The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. 
                  The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

                  <p> How one may interact with the DOM - Would be to change, add or modify a website in real time, in the DOM.</p>

                    <h2><li> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </li> </h2>

                  <p>  The difference with accessing data from arrays and objects,  </p>
                  <p> An array is able to hold more than one value at a time, under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number using the square brackets.</p>
                  <p> An object is similar to an Array can hold more than one value,  is a real object like a car that has properties like colour, name and model. 
                    They can be accessed  like this objectName.propertyName or 
                                                    objectName["propertyName"] using the square brackets. </p>
                  
                  
                  <h2> <li>  Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li> </h2>

                  Functions are one of the most used and fundamental building blocks of JS, It is a block of code or a set of statements that perform a specific task efficiently, fast and makes code reusable.
                  Functions are then called or returned with an output.     
                  Example: 
                     function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                    return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
                  }
            </ul>
