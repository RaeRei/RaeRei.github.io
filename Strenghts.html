                            Identity, </p>
                            So important to know who you are, and where you come from
                            and to where you are going. </p>

                            <br>

                            My connection to this land, goes with me to where ever I am and, continues with the generations to come.  </p>

                         <p> My Identity, draws on and was modelled by my Father, really from his struggles, and hard work. 
                           It comes from his stories and his life, and me watching him as a child, then as an adult.   </p>

                           <p>  Values, Who I am at this point, honestly I have good friends who do provide feedback, who I trust and who I appreciate daily.
                             They are watching as I journey this challenge, this course, and they actively support me. </p>
                            <br>
                            My Values, 
                            <br>
                            <strong> Honesty </strong>  Bring honest is an important quality to me, being legit as best I can, and in my intentions. I do 
                            struggle sometimes, as not all people appreciate honesty. 
                            <br> 
                            <strong> Loyalty </strong> So important, these principals really show off or show up who you really are, and actions speak louder than what your 
                            words can express.
                            <br> 
                            <strong> Gratitutde </strong> Another quality that has alot to do with attitude. Gratitude to me is being grateful, and acknowledging the awesomeness that is.
                            Being able to see the goodness and opportunity in any situation, and sometimes having a moment to swear and curse or vent!!! ka pai. As long
                            as that attitude does not last.  </p>

                           <p>  Strenghts </p>
                            <p> My Strenghts come from my Identity and Values, they enforce and empower my life and my responsibilities, not just to myself, but for my Whanau as well.
                                My strenghts are hard work and courage to follow and pursue what I want, to stand up and say I can do this. </p>
                                I have seen this quote and taken it for me, because this is where I am at right now.
                                <br>
                                <strong> <i>   "MY Goals Demand This Skill"  </strong> </i>
                            </p>
                          <br> 
                            <p> These Values and Principals, affect how I live and how i make decisions for me and my Tamariki. I think of my Whanau passed, and my Whanau to come. I think 
                              who will benefit and will I add value to what ever it may be. My Values and Principals have been learnt through pain and experience mostly, and then I choose 
                            my attitude. </p>
                            
                            <br>

                            <p> My Culture, Values and Strenghts influence my whole being, every decision and choice is influenced by these attributes. From raising my Tamariki to following my
                              decision to finish my job to study at Dev Academy. 
                              My choices are to learn and then to share this knowledge. 
                              Any obstacles, distractions or resistance I have already managed them by continuing on with this course, but am sure more will show up and I just push on becausse 
                              I have too.

                               <p> Examples or experience of teamwork, gone wrong .......  Where do I start, at present I am a member of the BOT of my daughters Kura.
                                   this involves 7 other people, some experienced in Governance and some not. So making decisions can be frustrating due to mis-understanding or no nunderstanding, so strategies
                                   are always being respectful, upholding their mana, and my own, and being honest about the process to make decisions.
                                  </p>
                                  <p> How effective are these strategies? well they are really effective especially when their is Trust within our BOT which makes a big difference for all.
                                    It also provides a safe place to speak and have a voice at the table.
                                  </p>
